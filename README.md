# 2D Game Engine - v-1.0
A 2D engine for building games and simulations\n
Developed in C++\n
Includes networking tools

## Prerequisites
The engine is fully self-contained which means you don't need to worry about the dependencies.
Instead, you'll just have to install Conan, a packet manager that will download all the necessary libraries for you
See : https://docs.conan.io/2/installation.html
